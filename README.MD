idk what goes in a markdown

aight so do you see that `sample input.txt` file? I made it on Excel. Save the table as a tab-deliminated file.

left/right click on cells to mark them as yes/no. or maybe it's no/yes. It's not my problem if you get it wrong I'm competing against you.

found a bug? fix it yourself
